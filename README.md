# RockPaperScissors

Rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project.

The task is to use JavaScript to create a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the user plays against the computer, initially using the console but to be revisited later to add a GUI.

The assignment said to make it play for 5 rounds, in the live previews of others' solutions I noticed that most of the solutions (that I saw at least) play first to 5, which could be, and often is, more than 5 rounds. However, I chose to stick to a set 5 rounds, I did consider making it best of 5 (first to 3), but this is also not playing for 5 rounds so decided to stick to what was asked.

What I've learned (Console version),

How to randomly select an item from an array.
How to write functions.
How to use for loops.
How to use if...else statements.
